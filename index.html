		<p>I am a CD major with a concentration in visual design. I am also minoring in business with a marketing concentration. I just transfered to CSUMB this semester from West Valley in Saratoga, CA. Before West Valley I also went to Sonoma State. I am now living in PG with my roommate, Tess and cat, Dexter. I am looking forward to learning a lot in this class!</p>
