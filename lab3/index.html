	<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
	<p>The objective of this lab was to further develop some of the skills used in lab 2.
	This includes the use of some of the basic html coding.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>I felt that a lot of the work was already done for me. I had worked through
	lab 2 with ease. This lab felt like it solidified what I had learned. I also
	that I learned a lot helping my partner who had been a little bebhind.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>Everything seems to be working as intended. I would like things to look a
	little nicer and organized. I hope to be able to do this soon.</p>
